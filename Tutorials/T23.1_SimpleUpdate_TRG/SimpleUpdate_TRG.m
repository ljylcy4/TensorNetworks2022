%% Simple update and tensor renormalization group
% Author: <https://cqm.snu.ac.kr Seung-Sup Lee>
%% 
% In this tutorial, we implement (i) the "simple update" method for finding 
% the ground state of a 2D quantum system via imaginary-time evolution, and (ii) 
% the tensor renormalization group (TRG) method for contracting exponentially 
% large 2D tensor networks. With this, we will obtain the PEPS representation 
% of the ground state of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on an exponentially large 
% honeycomb lattice with periodic boundary conditions.

%% Exercise (a): Complete the function for the simple update method on a honeycomb lattice
% There is a function |SimpleUp_Honeycomb_Ex.m| included in the same sub-directory 
% with this script. The function is designed to find the ground state, as a PEPS, 
% of a honeycomb lattice whose Hamiltonian consists of nearest-neighbor interaction 
% terms only.
% 
% The simple update method is a generalization of the iTEBD method (formultated 
% for 1D) to 2D problems. Here the imaginary-time evolution according to the whole 
% Hamiltonian is Trotter-decomposed into two-site gates that are given by exponentiating 
% the nearest-neighbor interaction terms. Also, it exploits the translational 
% invariance: There are two independent $\Gamma$ tensors, each of which sits on 
% a lattice site of the A or B sublattice. And there are three independent $\Lambda$ 
% tensors sitting on three different bonds (corresponding to three different directions 
% from a lattice site). Note in the iTEBD calculations for 1D systems, there were 
% only two $\Lambda$'s (for even and odd bonds) that are independent.

%% The ground state of the Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice
% To verify your implementation, you can run the following script. The simple 
% update method is based on the Trotter decomposition of the imaginary-time evolution. 
% So we construct a rank-4 tensor for the nearest-neighbor interaction $J \hat{\vec{S}}_i 
% \cdot \hat{\vec{S}}_j$, which will be exponentiated to get a two-site gate.

clear
% % system parameters
J = 1; % interaction strength
z = 3; % coordination number = number of nearest neighbors
[S,I] = getLocalSpace('Spin',1/2); % local operators
% Heisenberg interaction S*S as a two-site gate
HSS = J*contract(S,3,3,permute(conj(S),[2 1 3]),3,3);
%% 
% And we define the parameters for the simple update method. Here we use a small 
% maximum bond dimension, |Nkeep| = $D$ = 8, since the computational cost of the 
% simple update method, $O(D^{z+1}d^2) +O( D^3 d^6)$, increases quickly as $D$ 
% increases. Here $z$ is coordination number and $d$ is local space dimension. 
% Based on the similarity with the iTEBD, we take slowly but exponentially decreasing 
% step sizes for the imaginary-time evolution.

% % simple update parameters
Nkeep = 8;
beta_init = 1e-1; % initial imaginary time step size
beta_fin = 1e-4; % final imaginary time step size
Nstep = 1e4; % number of imaginary time steps
betas = beta_init*((beta_fin/beta_init).^linspace(0,1,Nstep));
% discrete imaginary time steps; decays slowly but exponentially
%% 
% Similarly as in the iTEBD, the simple update uses an ansatz wavefunction consists 
% of $\Gamma$ tensors (having physical legs) and $\Lambda$ tensors (connecting 
% $\Gamma$ tensors, carrying the information of entanglement at the bonds). We 
% initialize these tensors with random numbers.

% initialize Lambda and Gamma tensors
Lambda = cell(1,z); % for the bonds in three different directions
Lambda(:) = {rand(Nkeep,1)};
GA = rand([Nkeep*[1 1 1],size(I,2)]); % Gamma for sublattice A sites
GB = GA; % Gamma for sublattice B sites
%% 
% We use the leg order convention for the $\Gamma$ tensors such that the physical 
% leg is placed at the last; see the documentation of |SimpleUp_Honeycomb_Ex.m| 
% and |TRG_Honeycomb_Ex.m|.
% 
% Run the simple update method to obtain the $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ tensors 
% for the ground state.

[Lambda,GA,GB,Es] = SimpleUp_Honeycomb_Ex (Lambda,GA,GB,HSS,Nkeep,betas);

% Note that the fourth output |Es| is the energy measured only with respect 
% to the tensors that are updated. That is, we didn't consider the environment 
% tensors (i.e., the rest of the tensor network except for the tensors that are 
% updated). For many 1D calculations, the MPSs were in canonical forms, so the 
% role of the environment in measuring the energy was trivial. However, here we 
% don't have a canonical form. So the estimated energies in |Es| are inaccurate; 
% as you see, they are even increasing at later iterations!
% 
% To get an accurate estimate of the energy, we need to include the environment. 
% For example, the CTMRG is such a method. Here, we use the TRG for the calculation 
% of the ground-state energy.
%% Exercise (b): Complete the function for the TRG on a honeycomb lattice
% There is a function |TRG_Honeycomb_Ex.m| included in the same sub-directory 
% with this script. The function is designed to contract a network of reduced 
% tensors on an exponentially large honeycomb lattice with periodic boundary conditions. 
% The provided file is incomplete. Complete the parts enclosed by the comments 
% |TODO (start)| and |TODO (end)|.
% 
% There are several remarks.
%% 
% * *Leg order convention*: Inside the function, the tensor legs are permuted 
% to be in counter-clockwise (CC) order and indexed so that the legs of different 
% tensors but with the same indices are contracted together. This leg order convention 
% largely simplifies code writing. 
% * *Norm of tensors*: At each RG step, the number of sites in the lattice decreases 
% by 3 in the honeycomb lattice case. Rephrasing, the number of physical sites 
% represented by a single coarse-grained tensor increases by 3 after each RG step. 
% Without proper rescaling, the norm of the tensor may increase as a exponential 
% of an exponential (!) of the RG step iteration. So the total norm often numerically 
% diverges after a few steps. To deal with this numerically, the functions compute 
% the squared norm per lattice site, i.e., $( \langle\Psi | \Psi \rangle )^{1/N}$ 
% where $| \Psi \rangle$ is the total state and $N$ is the number of lattice sites.
% * *Last contraction step*: The RG steps are taken until we have a PEPS which 
% is small enough to contract exactly. In this honeycomb case, we contract the 
% last six tensors exactly.
% * There is a new function |PEPS/contPlaq.m| which contracts tensors arranged 
% around a plaquette. This function will be useful when one implements the contraction 
% of tensors to get coarse-grained tensors.
%% 
% Once you finish the above Exercise (b), you can run the following script.
% 
% To use the TRG, we reorganize the $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ tensors into "usual" 
% rank-4 tensors, each of which sit on a lattice site. We split the $\Lambda$ 
% tensors into their square roots $\sqrt{\Lambda}$, and let each $\sqrt{\Lambda}$ 
% be absorbed into the $\Gamma$ tensors. Then the ground state is expressed by 
% two rank-4 local tensors |TA| and |TB|.

TA = GA; TB = GB;
for it3 = (1:z)
    TA = contract(TA,z+1,it3,diag(sqrt(Lambda{it3})),2,2,[(1:it3-1),z+1,(it3:z)]);
    TB = contract(TB,z+1,it3,diag(sqrt(Lambda{it3})),2,1,[(1:it3-1),z+1,(it3:z)]);
end
%% 
% Then run the TRG.

E_GS = zeros(3,1); % for three different bond directions
rgstep = 11; % large enough number, to estimate the value in thermodynamic limit
Nkeep2 = 50; % larger bond dimension than in the simple update
[~,E_GS(1)] = TRG_Honeycomb_Ex (TA,TB, ...
    rgstep,Nkeep2,S,permute(conj(S),[2 1 3]));
%% 
% Note that the last input to |TRG_Honeycomb_Ex| is the Hermitian conjugate 
% of spin operator.

[~,E_GS(2)] = ...
    TRG_Honeycomb_Ex (permute(TA,[2 3 1 4]),permute(TB,[2 3 1 4]), ...
    rgstep,Nkeep2,S,permute(conj(S),[2 1 3]));
[~,E_GS(3)] = ...
    TRG_Honeycomb_Ex (permute(TA,[3 1 2 4]),permute(TB,[3 1 2 4]), ...
    rgstep,Nkeep2,S,permute(conj(S),[2 1 3]));
%% 
% To obtain the energy across different bond directions, we have rotated the 
% tensors |TA| and |TB| accordingly.

disp(E_GS)
%% 
% These energy values are close to each other, but not exactly the same. It 
% is similar as that in the iTEBD calculation the even- and odd-bond energies 
% are different and oscillating with iterations. So we average them.

disp(mean(E_GS))
%% 
% This is the ground-state energy per bond. On the other hand, Jiang2008 provides 
% the value per site. To make comparison, we multiply 3/2 to the value per bond.

disp(mean(E_GS)*(3/2))
%% 
% The error against the published result -0.5506 (for the bond dimension $D=8$, 
% in Jiang2008) is smaller than 0.4%.
