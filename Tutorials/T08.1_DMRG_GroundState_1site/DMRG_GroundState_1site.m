%% DMRG: Single-site update for ground state search
% Author: <https://cqm.snu.ac.kr Seung-Sup Lee>
%% 
% In this tutorial, we will obtain the ground state of one-dimensional systems 
% by using the *density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)*. 
%% XY spin chain: ground state search
% The first example to solve is the XY spin chain, where spin-1/2's lie along 
% a one-dimensional lattice of length $L$ and the spins have nearest-neighbor 
% interaction. The name "XY" comes from that only the $x$ and $y$ components of 
% the neighboring spins are coupled:
% 
% $$\hat{H}_{\mathrm{XY}}= -\sum_{\ell=1}^{L-1} (\hat{S}_{\ell,x} \hat{S}_{\ell+1,x} 
% + \hat{S}_{\ell,y} \hat{S}_{\ell+1,y})= -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\ell=1}^{L-1} (\hat{S}_{\ell,+} 
% \hat{S}_{\ell+1,-} + \hat{S}_{\ell,-} \hat{S}_{\ell+1,+}) .$$
% 
% By using the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation 
% Jordan-Wigner transformation>, the XY model is mapped onto a non-interacting 
% tight-binding chain of spinless fermions. So the model is exactly solvable, 
% though we numerically diagonalized the single-particle Hamiltonians in the previous 
% exercises. As shown in those exercises, the tight-binding chain show different 
% behaviors (e.g., ground-state degeneracy) depending on the parity of $L$. Here 
% we focus on even $L$, where the ground-state energy is
% 
% $$E_{0} = \frac12 - \frac{1}{2\sin \frac{\pi}{2(N+1)}} ,$$
% 
% and the correlation function of nearest-neighbor spins with respect to the 
% ground state is
% 
% $$\langle \Psi_0 |\hat{S}^+_\ell \hat{S}^-_{\ell+1} | \Psi_0 \rangle = \langle 
% \Psi_0 | \hat{S}^-_\ell \hat{S}^+_{\ell+1} | \Psi_0 \rangle = -\frac{1}{2(N+1)} 
% \left[  \frac{(-1)^\ell}{\sin\frac{(2\ell+1)\pi}{2(N+1)}} - \frac{1}{\sin\frac{\pi}{2(N 
% +1)}} \right] ,$$
% 
% where $| \Psi_0 \rangle$ means the ground state of the XY model. 
% 
% We will implement the single-site DMRG method and compare the DMRG result 
% with the exact one. Let's first set the parameters for the Hamiltonian and the 
% DMRG routine.

clear

% system parameter
J = -1; % coupling strength
L = 40; % number of sites in a chain

% DMRG parameter
Nkeep = 30; % bond dimension
Nsweep = 4; % number of pairs of left+right sweeps

% Local operators
[S,I] = getLocalSpace('Spin',1/2);
%% 
% Now we construct the bulk tensor for the MPO representation of the XY spin 
% chain Hamiltonian. The tensor comprises the $L-2$ tensors of the MPO, except 
% for the first and last tensors on the boundaries; hence bulk.

% % MPO formulation of Hamiltonian
% Hamiltonian tensor for each chain site
Hloc = cell(4,4);
Hloc(:) = {zeros(size(I))};
Hloc{1,1} = I;
Hloc{2,1} = S(:,:,1);
Hloc{3,1} = S(:,:,3);
Hloc{4,2} = J*S(:,:,1)';
Hloc{4,3} = J*S(:,:,3)';
Hloc{end,end} = I;
Hloc = cell2mat(reshape(Hloc,[1 1 size(Hloc,1) size(Hloc,2)]));

% full chain
Hs = cell(1,L);
Hs(:) = {Hloc};
Hs{1} = Hs{1}(:,:,end,:); % choose the last components of the left leg
Hs{end} = Hs{end}(:,:,:,1); % choose the first components of the right leg
%% Exercise (a): Initialize MPS with the iterative diagonalization result
% Before starting the iterative ground state search, we need to specify an MPS 
% as the starting point. For this, one can use either the iterative diagonalization 
% result or random tensors. Write the code that performs *iterative diagonalization 
% with the MPO Hamiltonian.* At each iteration, keep at most |Nkeep| states, *without* 
% keeping degenerate states near truncation thresholds altogether (or discard 
% them altogether). Obtain an MPS represented by a cell array |Minit|, where |Minit{n}| 
% is a rank-3 tensor for site n.
%% Exercise (b): Complete the single-site DMRG function
% There is a function |DMRG_GS_1site_Ex.m|, which is in the same sub-directory 
% with this script. It is incomplete. Complete the parts enclosed by the comments 
% |TODO (start)| and |TODO (end)|. Don't forget to also complete its sub-function 
% |eigs_1site_GS|!
%% 
% You can verify your solutions to Exercises (a) and (b) by comparing them with 
% the exact results. Upon successful implementation, the |DMRG_1site_Ex| function 
% will run like:

[M0,E0,Eiter] = DMRG_GS_1site(Minit,Hs,Nkeep,Nsweep);
%% 
% Compare the DMRG result of the ground-state energy, |E0|, with the exact value.

E0_exact = 0.5 - (1/2/sin(pi/2/(L+1))); % exact value
disptime(['Exact GS energy = ',sprintf('%.5g',E0_exact),', DMRG = ', ...
    sprintf('%.5g',E0),', error = ',sprintf('%.5g',E0-E0_exact)]);
%% 
% Plot how the expectation value of the Hamiltonian converges to the exact value 
% as iteration proceeds.

figure;
semilogy((1:numel(Eiter))/L,Eiter(:)-E0_exact,'LineWidth',1);
set(gca,'FontSize',13,'LineWidth',1);
xlim([0 2*Nsweep]);
grid on;
xlabel('# of sweeps');
ylabel('Ground-state energy error');
%% 
% The error is $O(10^{-6})$. The error can be further decreased by increasing 
% bond dimension |Nkeep|. Indeed, the accuracy is bound by finite bond dimension, 
% since the system is gapless. Consider a bipartition of the chain, into left 
% and right halves. The entanglement between two parts in the ground state increases 
% with the system size $L$ logarithmically, for the gapless systems. Thus, to 
% achieve the same accuracy, we should use larger bond dimension that increases 
% as the power law of $L$.
% 
% On the other hand, for the gapped systems, high accuracy can be achieved with 
% small bond dimensions. For example, the AKLT model needs only the bond dimension 
% 2.
%% Spin-spin correlation function
% Compute the spin-spin correlation function $\langle \Psi_0 | \hat{S}_{\ell,+} 
% \hat{S}_{\ell+1,-} | \Psi_0 \rangle$, i.e., the expectation value of the product 
% of spin-raising and -lowering operators at nearest-neighbor sites with respect 
% to the ground state $|\Psi_0\rangle$. Be aware of that the result MPS |M| is 
% in a left-canonical form, as mentioned in the documentation of |DMRG_GS_1site_Ex.m|.

% compute correlation function for the nearest-neighbour spins
SS = zeros(1,L-1);
for itN = (2:L)
    T = updateLeft([],[],M0{itN-1},S(:,:,1)*sqrt(2),3,M0{itN-1});
    T = updateLeft(T,3,M0{itN},S(:,:,3)*sqrt(2),3,M0{itN});
    
    for itN2 = ((itN+1):L)
        T = updateLeft(T,2,M0{itN2},[],[],M0{itN2});
    end
    
    SS(itN-1) = T;
end

    1./sin(pi/2/(L+1)))/(-2*(L+1));
