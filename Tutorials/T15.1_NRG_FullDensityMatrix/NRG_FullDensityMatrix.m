%% NRG: Full density matrix
% Author: <https://cqm.snu.ac.kr Seung-Sup Lee>
%% 
% In this tutorial, we will construct "full" density matrix, which is the representation 
% of thermal density matrix in the Andersâ€“Schiller (AS) basis.
%% Exercise (a): Complete the function for constructing the full density matrix
% There is a function |getRhoFDM_Ex.m|, which is in the same sub-directory with 
% this script. This function is designed to construct the full density matrix. 
% The function is incomplete. Complete the parts enclosed by the comments |TODO 
% (start)| and |TODO (end)|.
% 
% Also answer the "Quick Exercise" appear in the demonstration below.
%% Reduced density matrix at the impurity site
% To verify your implementation, you can run the following script. Below we 
% will analyze the reduced density matrix of the local space covering only the 
% impurity degress of freedom for different system temperatures.
% 
% First, run the iterative diagonalization for the SIAM. Here we use the same 
% parameters as those used in the last tutorial.

clear

% Hamiltonian parameters
U = 4e-3; % Coulomb interaction at the impurity
epsd = -U/2; % impurity on-site energy
Delta0 = 2.5e-4; % hybridization strength
D = 1; % half-bandwidh
ozin = [-1;1]*D; % frequency grid to define the hybridization
RhoV2in = [1;1]*(Delta0/pi); % hybridization function on the ozin grid

% NRG parameters
Lambda = 2.5; % discretization parameter
N = 55; % length of the Wilson chain
Nkeep = 300;

% Wilson chain
[ff,gg] = doCLD(ozin,RhoV2in,Lambda,N);
%% 
% Note that we don't post-process the Wilson chain parameters as we did for 
% the previous tutorials, since the calculations in this tutorial are stable against 
% the (very) small numerical noise that mattered previously.

% Construct local operators
[F,Z,S,I] = getLocalSpace('FermionS');

% Particle number operators
NF = cat(3,contract(conj(F(:,:,1)),3,[1 3],F(:,:,1),3,[1 3]), ...
           contract(conj(F(:,:,2)),3,[1 3],F(:,:,2),3,[1 3]));
       
% Impurity Hamiltonian
H0 = U*(NF(:,:,1)*NF(:,:,2)) + epsd*(NF(:,:,1)+NF(:,:,2));

% ket tensor for the impurity
A0 = getIdentity(1,2,I,2,[1 3 2]); % 1 for dummy leg

% iterative diagonalization
Inrg = NRG_IterDiag(H0,A0,Lambda,ff,F,gg,sum(NF,3),Z,Nkeep);
%% 
% A conceptual advantages of the full density matrix scheme is that one can 
% choose arbitrary temperatures, as long as they are sufficiently larger than 
% the energy scale for the last Wilson chain site, without the need of a free 
% parameter. Meanwhile, the conventional NRG scheme requires temperatures be of 
% type $\beta_0 \Lambda^{-n/2}$ (up to a prefactor), where $\beta_0$ is an arbitrary 
% free parameter.

Ts = 10.^(1:-0.5:-7).'; % temperature range
RK = cell(numel(Ts),1); % cell array to conatin the reduced density matrices

for itT = (1:numel(Ts))
    Inrg = getRhoFDM_Ex (Inrg,Ts(itT)); % construct FDM
    RK{itT} = Inrg.RK{1};
end
%% 
% Let's check whether the reduced density matrices are diagonal. (*Quick Exercise 
% 1:* Why is the reduced density matrix at the impurity site diagonal?)

disp(max(cellfun(@(x) max(max(abs(x - diag(diag(x))))), RK)));
%% 
% This value is on the order of numerical precision, so we confirm the diagonality 
% of the matrices.
% 
% Also, we can check whether the reduced density matrices respect the particle-hole 
% symmetry. According to our convention used in |getLocalSpace.m| (refer to the 
% documentation in the function file, for details), the basis of the impurity 
% space is $\{ | 0 \rangle , \hat{d}_{\uparrow}^\dagger | 0 \rangle , \hat{d}_{\downarrow}^\dagger 
% | 0 \rangle , \hat{d}_{\downarrow}^\dagger \hat{d}_{\uparrow}^\dagger | 0 \rangle 
% \}$, where $| 0 \rangle$ denotes the vacuum state. So we can check the particle-hole 
% symmetry as follows:

disp(max(cellfun(@(x) max(abs(flipud(diag(x))-diag(x))), RK)));
%% 
% Again, this value is on the order of numerical precision, so we confirm the 
% symmetry.
%% Double occupation vs. temperature
% Let's compute the double occupation $\langle \hat{n}_{d \uparrow} \hat{n}_{d\downarrow} 
% \rangle$ at the impurity, where $\hat{n}_{d\sigma} = \hat{d}_{\sigma}^\dagger 
% \hat{d}_{\sigma}$ is the number operator for spin-$\sigma$ electron at the impurity 
% site. It can be measured by contracting the double occupation operator $\hat{n}_{d 
% \uparrow} \hat{n}_{d\downarrow}$ and the reduced density matrices.

Dop = NF(:,:,1)*NF(:,:,2); % operator measuring for double occupation
Dvals = zeros(size(Ts)); % expectation value of Dop

for itT = (1:numel(Ts))
    % contract the reduced density matrix at the impurity 
    % with the operator
    Dvals(itT) = trace(updateLeft([],[], ...
        Inrg.AK{1},Dop,2,Inrg.AK{1})*RK{itT});
end

figure;
semilogx(Ts/U,Dvals,'Marker','x','LineWidth',1);
set(gca,'FontSize',13,'LineWidth',1);
xlabel('$T/U$','Interpreter','latex');
ylabel('$\langle \hat{n}_{d \uparrow} \hat{n}_{d \downarrow} \rangle$', ...
    'Interpreter','latex');
grid on;
%% 
% We see that the double occupation $\langle \hat{n}_{d \uparrow} \hat{n}_{d 
% \downarrow} \rangle$ decreases with decreasing $T$ with a crossover around $T 
% \sim U$. On the other hand, the double occupation saturates in the low-temperature 
% regime $T \ll U$: it means that the charge fluctuation is "frozen" by low temperature.
% 
% (*Quick Exercise 2:* Why is the double occupation close to 0.25 at highest 
% temperatures?)
