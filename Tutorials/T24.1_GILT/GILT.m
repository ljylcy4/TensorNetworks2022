% Author: <https://cqm.snu.ac.kr Seung-Sup Lee>
%% 
% In this tutorial, we implement the tensor renormalization group (TRG) and 
% the graph-independent local truncations (GILT) for a square lattice.
%% Exercise (a): Complete the function for the TRG and the GILT for a square lattice
% There is a function |TRG_GILT_Square_Ex.m| included in the same sub-directory 
% with this script. This function is designed to perform the TRG calculations 
% of contracting a tensor network on an exponentially large square lattice with 
% periodic boundary conditions. If an option |GILT| is set with a positive integer, 
% then the function will also perform the GILT to optimize the bonds between the 
% tensors.

%% Tensor network representation of the partition function of the classical Ising model
% We revisit the example of the classical Ising model on a square lattice, to 
% verify our implementation of TRG and GILT-TNR.
% 
% In a previous tutorial on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group 
% (CTMRG), we constructed a PEPS $|\psi (\beta) \rangle$ that expresses the thermal 
% ensemble of the classical Ising model; for example, the squared norm $\langle 
% \psi (\beta) | \psi (\beta) \rangle$ is the partition function. The PEPS has 
% a one-site unit cell, represented by a rank-5 tensor, whose legs are all of 
% dimension 2. Then for the computation of the partition function (or equivalently, 
% free energy), the rank-5 tensor is contracted to its conjugate to build a reduced 
% tensor, which is rank-4 and has legs of dimension 4.
% 
% Actually, if we are interested only in the partition function, we can have 
% a more compact representation of the reduced tensor. Let's consider a 2-by-2 
% matrix sitting on a bond between two sites $m$ and $n$, whose elements are given 
% by the Boltzmann weights with respect to the nearest-neighbor interaction between 
% $m$ and $n$:
% 
% $$W_{\sigma_m \sigma_n} = \exp \left[\beta (-1)^{\sigma_m + \sigma_n} \right] 
% .$$
% 
% Here $\sigma = 1 (2)$ is the index for spin-up (down) state, respectively. 
% Then the $W$ matrix, which is Hermitian, can be decomposed into $M M^\dagger$, 
% where $M$ is a 2-by-2 matrix with elements
% 
% $$M_{1,1} = M_{2,1} = \sqrt{\cosh \beta}, \quad M_{1,2} = -M_{2,2} = \sqrt{\sinh 
% \beta}.$$
% 
% Then we contract four $M$'s (each of which correponds to an edge attached 
% to a lattice site) with a tensor whose elements are defined by a Kronecker delta, 
% to get a reduced tensor. A compact definition of the "reduced" tensor is given 
% by
% 
% $$T_{l u d r} = \sum_{\sigma = 1,2} M_{\sigma l} M_{\sigma u} M_{\sigma d} 
% M_{\sigma r}.$$
% 
% Refer to Sec. II A of Hauru2018 for the details.

% Let's consider the temperatures around the critical temperature $T_c = 2/\ln 
% (1+ \sqrt{2})$.

        reshape(M,[2 1 1 2]).* ...
        reshape(M,[2 1 1 1 2]),1),[2 2 2 2]);

    Ftrg(itb) = -log(Nsq)/betas(itb);

% While the log message is suppressed since it's too long, I would suggest you 
% to look at it. From the log message, we can see that there are more GILT iterations 
% performed to achieve a given convergence criterion, as $\beta$ gets closer to 
% $\beta_c$. It means that the role of GILT, which (i) removes the irrelevant 
% contributions to the contraction result and (ii) allocates the bond spaces to 
% more important contributions, becomes more significant near $\beta_c$.
%% 
% This advantage of using the GILT-TNR in comparison to the bare TRG is quantitatively 
% visible from the plot of the errors in free energy.

% We find that, for $\beta \neq \beta_c$, the GILT-TNR results in only one (for 
% $\beta < \beta_c$) or two (for $\beta > \beta_c$) singular values at the last 
% coarse-graining steps, while the TRG keeps many singular values. As we can see 
% from the error plot, those small singular values are irrelevant.
% 
% Actually, in the RG sense, the structure of the singular values at the last 
% steps should capture the long-range behavior of the system, with all short-range 
% features removed. For higer temperatures ($\beta < \beta_c$), the system is 
% disordered. If we ignore short-range details, the state is similar to the infinite-temperature 
% ($\beta = 0$) state, whose tensor network (TN) representation is very simple; 
% all the tensors have singleton bond dimensions, since the spins are uncorrelated. 
% So the uniquley surviving singular value at the last step of GILT-TNR for $\beta 
% < \beta_c$ corresponds to the $\beta = 0$ fixed point with the separable TN 
% representation.
% 
% On the other hand, for lower temperatures ($\beta > \beta_c$), the system 
% is in a symmetry-broken phase with two possible configurations. One configuration 
% has spin-up magnetization and the other has spin-down. Each configuration has 
% a PEPS representation (again) with singleton dimensions. The two singular values 
% at the last coarse-graining step of GILT-TNR for $\beta > \beta_c$ counts the 
% two configurations.
% 
% Meanwhile, the bare TRG cannot eliminate short-range features, that remain 
% as sub-leading singular values.
% 
% Note that, in the CTMRG, the sub-leading singular values are kept since the 
% corner and transfer tensors are coarse-grained only towards the outside; their 
% legs towards the unit cell should know about the short-range features.
