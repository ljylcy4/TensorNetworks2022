%% DMRG: Two-site update for ground state search
% Author: <https://cqm.snu.ac.kr Seung-Sup Lee>
%% 
% In this tutorial, we will implement the two-site update DMRG method for ground 
% state search.
%% Exercise (a): Complete the two-site DMRG function
% There is a function |DMRG_GS_2site_Ex.m|, which is in the same sub-directory 
% with this script. It is incomplete. Complete the parts enclosed by the comments 
% |TODO (start)| and |TODO (end)|.
% 
% In the two-site update, you can decrease the bond dimensions by discarding 
% ingular values smaller than $10^{-8}$ and their corresponding singular vectors 
% as the _truncated_ SVD. It is because the decreased bond dimensions can be increased 
% back again, if needed, within the two-site update.
% 
% On the other hand, in the single-site update, bond dimensions cannot increase; 
% so one should use the _thin_ SVD (as opposed to the truncated SVD) that removes 
% trivial zero contributions (coming from the mismatch between the row and column 
% dimensions) only.
%% 
% We revisit the XY spin chain to verify the code implementation. Here, we use 
% a random MPS as the initial guess for both the single- and two-site updates, 
% to compare their performance.

% For most cases, the two-site update better converges to the solution in terms 
% of number of sweeps. At each iteration, the bond space between the two tensors 
% that are updated is identified by SVD-ing a rank-4 tensor given by the Lanczos 
% solution of the effective Hamiltonian. The bond space can be optimized by exploring 
% larger space (of dimension $Dd$ in the standard naming convention, or |Nkeep*size(I,2)| 
% in this code) and then truncating it. By contrast, in the single-site update, 
% the bond spaces are fixed, as they are also spanned by the right and left legs 
% of the left and right neighbor tensors (that are fixed in the current iteration), 
% respectively.
% 
% Of course, the two-site update takes more computational cost than the single-site 
% update; see the time lap record above. Therefore, it is desirable to have a 
% method having a better convergence behavior as the two-site update while having 
% a cheaper computational cost comparable to the single-site update.
%% Exercise (b): Majumdar-Ghosh model
% In this Exercise, we consider another spin chain model. The Majumdar-Ghosh 
% model is a spin-1/2 chain with the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor 
% interactions,
% 
% $$\hat{H} = \sum_{\ell=1}^{L-1} \hat{\vec{S}}_\ell \cdot \hat{\vec{S}}_{\ell+1} 
% + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\ell=1}^{L-2} \hat{\vec{S}}_\ell \cdot \hat{\vec{S}}_{\ell+2} 
% .$$
% 
% The model has an analytic solution of the ground state, which has energy $-3L/8$.
% 
% Compute the ground state of this system by using the two-site update DMRG 
% and compare the numerical ground-state energy with the exact value. Once you 
% look into the output MPS, you will find a peculiarity of the ground state. Explain 
% the peculiarity by plotting the singular values (obtained as the fourth output 
% of |DMRG_GS_2site_Ex.m|.) and computing the spin-spin correlation function $\langle 
% \hat{S}_{\ell,+} \hat{S}_{\ell+1,-} \rangle$

% U. SchollwÃ¶ck, Ann. Phys. *326*, 96 (2011)>] to find an MPO representation of 
% the Hamiltonian with the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions.)
