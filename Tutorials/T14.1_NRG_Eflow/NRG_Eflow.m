%% NRG: Iterative diagonalization and energy flow
% Author: <https://cqm.snu.ac.kr Seung-Sup Lee>
% 
% The numerical renormalization group (NRG) is a tensor network method specialized 
% in solving quantum impurity systems. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_G._Wilson 
% Kenneth G. Wilson> has itnvented NRG to solve the Kondo problem which was not 
% solvable then. The invention of NRG, indeed, is a part of his Nobel prize citation. 
% NRG is an ancestor of all numerical methods having "renormalization group" in 
% their names.
%% Exercise (a): Complete the functions for the logarithmic discretization and the iterative diagonalization
% There are two functions, (i) |doCLD_Ex.m| for the Campo–Oliveira logarithmic 
% discretization proposed by Campo2005 [<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.72.104432 
% V. L. Campo and L. N. Oliveira, Phys. Rev. B *72*, 104432 (2005)>] and (ii) 
% |NRG_IterDiag_Ex.m| for the NRG-style iterative diagonalization, contained in 
% the same sub-directory whith this script. These functions are incomplete. Complete 
% the parts enclosed by the comments |TODO (start)| and |TODO (end)|.
% 
% Also answer the "Quick Exercises" appear in the demonstration below.
% 
% Note that in this tutorial we use a slightly different convention for indexing 
% the Wilson chain parameters (hopping amplitudes, on-site energies), chain sites, 
% and iteration indices, compared with the convention used in the lecture note. 
% Here, iteration 0 involves only the spaces spanned by the input isometry |A0|; 
% iteration 1 also involves the next site from the bath; and so on. That is, iteration 
% indices in this convention are larger than those in the lecture note's convention 
% by 1.
%% 
% Once you solve Exercise (a), you can run the following demonstration in which 
% a single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM) is solved by using the NRG. In this 
% example, we consider a box-shaped hybridization function $\Delta'' (\omega) 
% = (\Delta_0 / \pi) \theta (D - \omega)$, where $\omega$ is the half-bandwidth 
% of the bath.

clear

Delta0 = 2.5e-4; % hybridization strength
D = 1; % half-bandwidh
ozin = [-1;1]*D; % frequency grid to define the hybridization
RhoV2in = [1;1]*(Delta0/pi); % hybridization function on the ozin grid
%% 
% Let's first see whether the logarithmic discretization works correctly.

% NRG parameters
Lambda = 2.5; % discretization parameter
N = 55; % length of the Wilson chain

[ff,gg] = doCLD_Ex (ozin,RhoV2in,Lambda,N);
%% 
% There are two points to verify your implementation of |doCLD_Ex.m|.
% 
% (i) The first element |ff(1)| (= $t_0$ in the lecture note's convention) should 
% be fixed,
% 
% $$t_0^2 = \int_{-D}^{D} \mathrm{d}\omega \, \Delta'' (\omega) = 2 \Delta_0 
% D / \pi,$$
% 
% being independent from the choices of |Lambda| (= $\Lambda$). [*Quick Exercise 
% 1:* why?]
% 
% (ii) The elements |ff(n)| should scale as $\Lambda^{-n/2}$ for sufficiently 
% large $n$. [*Quick Exercise 2*: Why $\Lambda^{-n/2}$, not $\Lambda^{-n}$? We 
% started from the discretization grid of $\pm \Lambda^{-n}$, so it might look 
% weird to have factor 1/2 in the exponent; but of course, there is a good reason.]
% 
% We first check the first point.

disp(ff(1)^2 - 2*Delta0*D/pi)
%% 
% And we check the second point by mulitping rescaling factor $\Lambda^{n/2}$.

%% 
% The first elements of |ff| deviate from the exponential dependence, as we 
% see the deviation from the horizontal line. They come from the specific details 
% of the hybridization function, such as a sharp edge at $\omega = \pm D$ for 
% the box-shaped hybridization function.

% Set the parameters that define the Anderson impurity.

% Impurity Hamiltonian parameters
U = 4e-3; % Coulomb interaction at the impurity
epsd = -U/2; % impurity on-site energy

% Construct local operators
[F,Z,S,I] = getLocalSpace('FermionS');

% Particle number operators
NF = cat(3,contract(conj(F(:,:,1)),3,[1 3],F(:,:,1),3,[1 3]), ...
           contract(conj(F(:,:,2)),3,[1 3],F(:,:,2),3,[1 3]));
       
% Impurity Hamiltonian
H0 = U*(NF(:,:,1)*NF(:,:,2)) + epsd*(NF(:,:,1)+NF(:,:,2));

% ket tensor for the impurity
A0 = getIdentity(1,2,I,2,[1 3 2]); % 1 for dummy leg
%% 
% Let's run the iterative diagonalization.

% NRG parameter
Nkeep = 300;

% iterative diagonalization
Inrg = NRG_IterDiag_Ex (H0,A0,Lambda,ff,F,gg,sum(NF,3),Z,Nkeep);
%% 
% Each message line from the |NRG_IterDiag| indicates time stamp, number of 
% the kept states, number of the total states, the largest energy of the kept 
% states, the largest energy of the discarded states.
%% Energy flow diagam
% NRG provides a method to analyze the spectrum obtained along the iterative 
% diagonalization. Let's plot the lowest-lying (many-body) energy levels. We plot 
% the results from even iterations and those from odd iterations separately.

% Energy flow diagram
Eshow = 3; % energy window to show (from 0 to Eshow)

% since we start from A0; consider the step for H0 as 0, i.e., even
Eeven = Inrg.EK(1:2:end);
Eeven = cellfun(@(x) x(x <= Eshow), Eeven, 'UniformOutput', 0);
maxEeven = max(cellfun('prodofsize',Eeven));
Eeven = cellfun(@(x) [x;nan(maxEeven-numel(x),1)], Eeven, 'UniformOutput', 0);
Eeven = cell2mat(Eeven).';

Eodd = Inrg.EK(2:2:end);
Eodd = cellfun(@(x) x(x <= Eshow), Eodd, 'UniformOutput', 0);
maxEodd = max(cellfun('prodofsize',Eodd));
Eodd = cellfun(@(x) [x;nan(maxEodd-numel(x),1)], Eodd, 'UniformOutput', 0);
Eodd = cell2mat(Eodd).';
%% 
% (Note that |cellfun('prodofsize', ...)| is undocumented functionality, which 
% gives the same result as |cellfun(@numel, ...)| but much faster. Refer to <http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/cellfun-undocumented-performance-boost 
% this webpage>.)

% These plots are called energy flow diagrams or finite-size energy spectra. 
% The name "flow" literally comes from that the lines flow from one regime to 
% the other. There are three regions (iterations 1–10; 17–25; 35–55) connected 
% via two crossovers. These regions correspond to different fixed points: free 
% orbital, local moment, and strong coupling. The strong-coupling fixed-point 
% regime exhibits prominent plateau of the energy levels.
%% Exercise (b): Reproduce lowest-lying energies in the strong-coupling regime by fixed-point Hamiltonians
% Let's consider iteration 53 (counting from iteration 0 for the impurity only) 
% in the strong-coupling fixed-point regime. Their lowet-lying energies, including 
% all degenerate levels, are:

fprintf([sprintf('%.4f, ',Inrg.EK{54}(1:5).'),'\n', ...
    sprintf('%.4f, ',Inrg.EK{54}(6:11).'),'...\n']);
%% 
% We see 1-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold degeneracies. On the other hand, the energy 
% levels at the next iteration 54 have more degeneracies:

fprintf([sprintf('%.4f, ',Inrg.EK{55}(1:4).'),'\n', ...
    sprintf('%.4f, ',Inrg.EK{55}(5:12).'),'\n', ...
    sprintf('%.4f, ',Inrg.EK{55}(13:20).'),'...\n']);
%% 
% There are 4-fold and 16-fold degeneracies, up to numerical noise of $O(10^{-6})$.
% 
% Reproduce these (many-body) energy values by considering strong-coupling fixed-point 
% Hamiltonians.
% 
% (_Hint_: The fixed-point Hamiltonians are single-particle Hamiltonians, effectively!)
%% Exercise (c): Single-impurity Kondo model
% We can derive the Wilson chain Hamiltonian for the single-impurity Kondo model 
% (SIKM), from the chain Hamiltonian of the SIAM. By applying the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrieffer%E2%80%93Wolff_transformation 
% Schrieffer–Wolff transformation> (SWT) to the impurity site (on which $\hat{d}_\sigma$ 
% acts) and the first bath site (on which $\hat{f}_{0\sigma}$ acts), we obtain
% 
% $$\hat{H}_\mathrm{SIKM} = 2J \hat{\vec{S}}_d \cdot \hat{\vec{S}}_0 + \sum_{n 
% = 1}^{N} \sum_{\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow} (t_n \hat{f}_{n\sigma}^\dagger f_{n-1,\sigma} 
% + \mathrm{h.c.}) + \sum_{n=0}^{N} \sum_{\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow} \epsilon_n 
% \hat{f}_{n\sigma}^\dagger \hat{f}_{n\sigma}.$$
% 
% Here $\hat{\vec{S}}_d$ is the spin operator acting on the impurity site,
% 
% $$\hat{\vec{S}}_0 = \sum_{\sigma,\sigma'} \hat{f}_{0\sigma}^\dagger \frac{\vec{\sigma}_{\sigma,\sigma'}}{2} 
% \hat{f}_{0\sigma'}$$
% 
% is the spin operator acting on the first bath site, $\vec{\sigma} = [\sigma_x, 
% \sigma_y, \sigma_z]$ is the vector of the Pauli matrices, and
% 
% $$J = t_0^2 \left( \frac{1}{-\epsilon_d} + \frac{1}{U + \epsilon_d} \right)$$
% 
% is the Kondo coupling strength. For particle-hole symmetric case $\epsilon_d 
% = -U/2$ which we considered above, it becomes
% 
% $$J = \frac{4 t_0^2}{U} = \frac{8 \Delta_0 D}{\pi U}.$$
% 
% The remaining bath term is the same as in the SIAM case. Note that the impurity 
% site in the SIKM has dimension 2, while that in the SIAM has 4; the doubly occupied 
% and the empty states are "integrated out" by the SWT. Refer to Schrieffer1966 
% [<https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.149.491 J. R. Schrieffer 
% and P. A. Wolff, Phys. Rev. *149*, 491 (1966)>]) for the details of the SWT.
% 
% Perform the iterative diagonalization of this chain Hamiltonian for the SIKM, 
% with the value of $J$ corresponding to the choice of parameters $U$, $\epsilon_d$, 
% $\Gamma$, and $D$ used for the SIAM above. Compare the energy flow diagram with 
% the SIAM result.
