%% Tensor decomposition and entanglement entropy
% Author: <https://cqm.snu.ac.kr Seung-Sup Lee>
%% 
% In this tutorial, we will decompose a high-rank tensor into a matrix product 
% state (MPS) that consists of rank-2 and -3 tensors, by using the QR decomposition 
% or the singular value decomposition (SVD).
% 
% Let's define a rank-5 tensor acting onto five subsystems, whose dimensions 
% are 2, 3, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

clear
sz = [2 3 2 3 4]; % local space dimensions
T = reshape((1:prod(sz)),sz); % rank-5 tensor
T = T/norm(T(:)); % normalize
%% 
% Here |T| is normalized by its norm. Note that, for the computation of the 
% norm, it's necessary to take a linearized form of the tensor by using |(:)|.
% 
% I will demonstrate the decomposition of the tensor "from left to right", i.e., 
% decomposing a tensor for the first leg, then for the second, and so on, by using 
% the QR decomposition:
% 
% 
% 
% The numbers next to the tensor legs indicate the order of the legs. A left-unitary 
% matrix obtained after the $n$-th QR decomposition are reshaped and stored in 
% the $n$-th cell |Q{n}|. At the last iteration (i.e., the fourth iteration), 
% we dump the remaining tensor into |Q{5}|. For |Q{1}| and |Q{5}|, we assign the 
% dummy legs of dimension 1, indicated by the x symbols at the ends. By introducing 
% the dummy legs, we can treat all the tensors |Q{n}| as rank-3, which simplifies 
% the code writing.

Q = cell(1,numel(sz));
R = T; % temporary tensor to be QR-decomposed
szl = 1; % the bond dimension of the left leg of Q{n} to be obtained after
% the QR decomposition at iteration n; for n = 1, szl = 1 for the dummy leg
for it = (1:(numel(sz)-1))
    R = reshape(R,[szl*sz(it), prod(sz(it+1:end))]);
    [Q{it},R] = qr(R,0);
    Q{it} = reshape(Q{it},[szl, sz(it), numel(Q{it})/szl/sz(it)]);
    Q{it} = permute(Q{it},[1 3 2]); % permute to the left-right-bottom order
    szl = size(Q{it},2); % update the bond dimension
    R = reshape(R,[szl,sz(it+1:end)]);
end
Q{end} = permute(R,[1 3 2]);

% Note we use the thin QR decomposition by setting the second input argument 
% to |qr| as |0|.

% Check the dimensions of tensors in the MPS.

% Note that the MATLAB automatically truncates the trailing singleton dimension, 
% so the dummy leg dimension of |Q{5}| is not displayed.
%% Exercise (a): Check the integrity of the tensor decomposition
% Contract the tensors |Q{1}|, ..., |Q{5}| to make a rank-5 tensor again. Check 
% whether the contraction result is the same as the original tensor |T|.
%% Exercise (b): Entanglement entropies for different bipartitions
% Compute the entanglement entropy $S_{\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{B}}$ for the following 
% three ways of bipartitioning the tensor |T|'s fives legs into two sets, A and 
% B:
% 
% (i) A = {1, 2}, B = {3, 4, 5};
% 
% (ii) A = {1, 3}, B = {2, 4, 5};
% 
% (iii) A = {1, 5}, B = {2, 3, 4}.
%% Exercise (c): Use the SVD for the tensor decomposition and compute the entanglement entropy
% Let's consider the same tensor |T| defined above. Apply the series of the 
% SVD from left to right to decompose |T| into an MPS, represented by a cell array 
% |M|.
%% 
% # At each step $n$ of the SVD, compute the entanglement entropy $S_n = - \sum_i 
% s_i^2 \log_2 (s_i^2)$ by using the singular values $\{ s_i \}$. What are the 
% values of $S_n$ for different iterations?
% # After the SVD, truncate the decomposed components associated with the singular 
% values smaller than the double precision accuracy limit |eps|. How do the size 
% of tensors |M{n}| differ from the above results |Q{n}|? 
% # Similarly as in Exercise (a), check whether the contraction of |M{n}|'s 
% reproduce the original tensor |T|.
